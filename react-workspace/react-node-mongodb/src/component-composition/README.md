- React recommends using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components.

- It's about passing React Element in props and in props.children.


## Containment
 - Sidebar, Dialog, FancyBorder
 - should use children prop to pass children elements directly into their output.
 - For example see WelcomeDialog and SplitPane
 
 
## Specialization
 - Like WelcomeDialog is a special case of Dialog.
